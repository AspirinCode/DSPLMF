# DSPLMF
 A novel method for cancer Drug Sensitivity Prediction using Logistic Matrix Factorization
 
 
The implemenation of DSPLMF is presented in "main.python" file. Which runs the DSPLMF algorithm on cell lines and drugs and returns the probalities that cell lines are to sensitive to drugs. The file "functions.python" includes the code of fuctions that are used for evaluation and load data and code of logistic matrix factorization algorithm that is regularized by similarity matrices.
